# imba-rails-test
quick demo for troubleshooting

Example here:

I didn't attempt to match the styles of http://imba.io/#/examples/dynamic.imba

This is the index.html.erb file (found in app/views/welcome/):
'''
    <h2>Imba Test</h2>
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'application' %>
    <sample>
'''
All of the rest of the files are included in this repo under javascripts/ (this folder is app/assets/javascripts in the rails app)
